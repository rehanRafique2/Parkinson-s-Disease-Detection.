#Parkinson Disease Detection


This project aimed to predict Parkinson's disease using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The analysis involved the following steps:

Importing and exploring the Parkinson's disease data.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Preprocessing the data by standardizing the features.
Defining and training an SVM model with a linear kernel.
Predicting the target variable for the training data.
Calculating the accuracy score of the model's predictions on the training data.
The project successfully trained an SVM model for Parkinson's disease prediction.
